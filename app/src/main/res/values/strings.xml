        In this MapActivity i do not have a Place and Directions enabled Api.So
        \n\n
        1. I am getting a place from the edittext shown in the top and convert it to latitude and longitude using Geocoder. After that i am placing a marker in that Location and directions button will be visible.\n\n
        2. I do not have directions enabled key so whenever i am passing the source and destinations location in directions api the result shows like REQUEST DENIED and does not draw poly line.\n\n
        Thank You
